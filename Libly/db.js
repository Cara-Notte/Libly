/*
 * Database connection helper for Libly
 *
 * This module loads environment variables from a .env file located in the
 * same directory as server.js and establishes a connection pool to a
 * MySQL/MariaDB database using mysql2/promise.  The pool is created
 * lazily to ensure that environment variables are loaded before we read
 * them.  A small connection limit is used by default to avoid
 * exhausting local resources during development; adjust DB_CONN_LIMIT
 * in your .env as needed for production.
